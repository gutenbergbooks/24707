<p><img src="images/002.png" width="45" height="45" alt="M" title="M" /><span class="dcap">r.</span> Terrence Elshawe did
not conform to the
mental picture that
pops into the average
person's mind when he
hears the words "news reporter."
Automatically, one thinks of the
general run of earnest, handsome,
firm-jawed, level-eyed, smooth-voiced
gentlemen one sees on one's TV
screen. No matter which news service
one subscribes to, the reporters
are all pretty much of a type. And
Terrence Elshawe simply wasn't the
type.</p>

<p>The confusion arises because
thirty-odd years of television has resulted
in specialization. If you run
up much Magnum Telenews time on
your meter, you're familiar with the
cultured voice and rugged good looks
of Brett Maxon, "your Magnum reporter,"
but Maxon is a reporter
only in the very literal sense of the
word. He's an actor, whose sole job
is to make Magnum news sound more
interesting than some other telenews
service, even though he's giving you
exactly the same facts. But he
doesn't go out and dig up those
stories.</p>

<p>The actual leg work of getting the
news into Maxon's hands so that he
can report it to you is done by research
reporters&mdash;men like Terrence
Elshawe.</p>

<p>Elshawe was a small, lean man
with a large, round head on which
grew close-cropped, light brown
hair. His mouth was wide and full-lipped,
and had a distinct tendency
to grin impishly, even when he was
trying to look serious. His eyes were
large, blue, and innocent; only when
the light hit them at just the right
angle was it possible to detect the
contact lenses which corrected an
acute myopia.</p>

<p>When he was deep in thought, he
had a habit of relaxing in his desk
chair with his head back and his eyes
closed. His left arm would be across
his chest, his left hand cupping his
right elbow, while the right hand
held the bowl of a large-bowled
briar which Elshawe puffed methodically
during his ruminations. He was
in exactly that position when Oler
Winstein put his head in the door
of Elshawe's office.</p>

<p>"Busy?" Winstein asked conversationally.</p>

<p>In some offices, if the boss comes
in and finds an employee in a pose
like that, there would be a flurry of
sudden action on the part of the
employee as he tried frantically to
look as though he had only paused
for a moment from his busy work.
Elshawe's only reaction was to open
his eyes. He wasn't the kind of man
who would put on a phony act like
that, even if his boss fired him on
the spot.</p>

<p>"Not particularly," he said, in his
slow, easy drawl. "What's up?"</p>

<p>Winstein came on into the office.
"I've got something that might make
a good spot. See what you think."</p>

<p>If Elshawe didn't conform to the
stereotype of a reporter, so much less
did Oler Winstein conform to the
stereotype of a top-flight TV magnate.
He was no taller than Elshawe's
five-seven, and was only slightly
heavier. He wore his hair in a crew
cut, and his boyish face made him
look more like a graduate student at
a university than the man who had
put Magnum Telenews together
with his own hands. He had an office,
but he couldn't be found in it
more than half the time; the rest of
the time, he was prowling around
the Magnum Building, wandering
into studios and offices and workshops.
He wasn't checking up on his
employees, and never gave the impression
that he was. He didn't throw
his weight around and he didn't
snoop. If he hired a man for a job,
he expected the job to be done, that
was all. If it was, the man could
sleep at his desk or play solitaire or
drink beer for all Winstein cared; if
the work wasn't done, it didn't matter
if the culprit looked as busy as an
anteater at a picnic&mdash;he got one
warning and then the sack. The only
reason for Winstein's prowling
around was the way his mind worked;
it was forever bubbling with
ideas, and he wanted to bounce those
ideas off other people to see if anything
new and worthwhile would
come of them.</p>

<p>He didn't look particularly excited,
but, then, he rarely did. Even the
most objective of employees is likely
to become biased one way or another
if he thinks his boss is particularly
enthusiastic about an idea.
Winstein didn't want yes-men
around him; he wanted men who
could and would think. And he had
a theory that, while the tenseness of
an emergency could and did produce
some very high-powered thinking indeed,
an atmosphere of that kind
wasn't a good thing for day-in-and-day-out
work. He saved that kind
of pressure for the times that he
needed it, so that it was effective because
of its contrast with normal
procedure.</p>

<hr />

<p>Elshawe took his heavy briar out
of his mouth as Winstein sat down
on the corner of the desk. "You have
a gleam in your eye, Ole," he said
accusingly.</p>

<p>"Maybe," Winstein said noncommittally.
"We might be able to work
something out of it. Remember a
guy by the name of Malcom Porter?"</p>

<p>Elshawe lowered his brows in a
thoughtful frown. "Name's familiar.
Wait a second. Wasn't he the guy
that was sent to prison back in 1979
for sending up an unauthorized
rocket?"</p>

<p>Winstein nodded. "That's him.
Served two years of a five-year sentence,
got out on parole about a year
ago. I just got word from a confidential
source that he's going to try
to send up another one."</p>

<p>"I didn't know things were so
pleasant at Alcatraz," Elshawe said.
"He seems to be trying awfully hard
to get back in."</p>

<p>"Not according to what my informant
says. This time, he's going
to ask for permission. And this time,
he's going to have a piloted craft,
not a self-guided missile, like he did
in '79."</p>

<p>"Ho<i>ho</i>. Well, there might be a
story in it, but I can't see that it
would be much of one. It isn't as
if a rocket shoot were something
unusual. The only thing unusual
about it is that it's a private enterprise
shoot instead of a Government
one."</p>

<p>Winstein said: "Might be more
to it than that. Do you remember
the trial in '79?"</p>

<p>"Vaguely. As I remember it, he
claimed he didn't send up a rocket,
but the evidence showed overwhelmingly
that he had. The jury wasn't
out more than a few minutes, as I
remember."</p>

<p>"There was a little more to it
than that," Winstein said.</p>

<p>"I was in South Africa at the
time," Elshawe said. "Covering the
civil war down there, remember?"</p>

<p>"That's right. You're excused,"
Winstein said, grinning. "The thing
was that Malcom Porter didn't claim
he hadn't sent the thing up. What
he did claim was that it wasn't a
rocket. He claimed that he had a new
kind of drive in it&mdash;something that
didn't use rockets.</p>

<p>"The Army picked the thing up
on their radar screens, going straight
up at high acceleration. They bracketed
it with Cobra pursuit rockets
and blew it out of the sky when it
didn't respond to identification signals.
They could trace the thing
back to its launching pad, of course,
and they nabbed Malcom Porter.</p>

<p>"Porter was furious. Wanted to
slap a suit against the Government
for wanton destruction of private
property. His claim was that the law
forbids unauthorized rocket tests all
right, but his missile wasn't illegal
because it wasn't a rocket."</p>

<p>"What did he claim it was?" Elshawe
asked.</p>

<p>"He said it was a secret device of
his own invention. Antigravity, or
something like that."</p>

<p>"Did he try to prove it?"</p>

<p>"No. The Court agreed that, according
to the way the law is worded,
only 'rocket-propelled missiles'
come under the ban. The judge said
that if Malcom Porter could prove
that the missile wasn't rocket-propelled,
he'd dismiss the case. But
Porter wanted to prove it by building
another missile. He wouldn't give the
court his plans or specifications for
the drive he claimed he'd invented,
or say anything about it except that
it operated&mdash;and I quote&mdash;'on a new
principle of physics'&mdash;unquote. Said
he wouldn't tell them anything because
the Government was simply
using this as an excuse to take his
invention away from him."</p>

<p>Elshawe chuckled. "That's as
flimsy a defense as I've heard."</p>

<p>"Don't laugh," said Winstein. "It
almost worked."</p>

<p>"What? How?"</p>

<p>"It threw the burden of proof on
the Government. They thought they
had him when he admitted that he'd
shot the thing off, but when he denied
that it was a rocket, then, in
order to prove that he'd committed
a crime, they had to prove that it <i>was</i>
a rocket. It wasn't up to Porter to
prove that it <i>wasn't</i>."</p>

<p>"Hey," Elshawe said in admiration,
"that's pretty neat. I'm almost sorry
it didn't work."</p>

<hr />

<p>"Yeah. Trouble was that the Army
had blown up the evidence. They
knew it was a rocket, but they had
to prove it. They had recordings of
the radar picture, of course, and
they used that to show the shape
and acceleration of the missile. They
proved that he'd bought an old obsolete
Odin rocket from one of the
small colleges in the Midwest&mdash;one
that the Army had sold them as a
demonstration model for their rocket
engineering classes. They proved that
he had a small liquid air plant out
there at his place in New Mexico.
In other words, they proved that he
had the equipment to rebuild the
rocket and the fuel to run it.</p>

<p>"Then they got a battery of high-powered
physicists up on the stands
to prove that nothing else but a
rocket could have driven the thing
that way.</p>

<p>"Porter's attorney hammered at
them in cross-examination, trying to
get one of them to admit that it was
possible that Porter had discovered
a new principle of physics that could
fly a missile without rockets, but the
Attorney General's prosecutor had
coached them pretty well. They all
said that unless there was evidence
to the contrary, they could not admit
that there was such a principle.</p>

<p>"When the prosecutor presented
his case to the jury, he really had
himself a ball. I'll give you a transcript
of the trial later; you'll have
to read it for yourself to get the real
flavor of it. The gist of it was that
things had come to a pretty pass if
a man could claim a scientific principle
known only to himself as a
defense against a crime.</p>

<p>"He gave one analogy I liked. He
said, suppose that a man is found
speeding in a car. The cops find him
all alone, behind the wheel, when
they chase him down. Then, in court,
he admits that he was alone, and
that the car was speeding, but he
insists that the car was steering itself,
and that he wasn't in control
of the vehicle at all. And what was
steering the car? Why, a new scientific
principle, of course."</p>

<p>Elshawe burst out laughing.
"Wow! No wonder the jury didn't
stay out long! I'm going to have to
dig the recordings of the newscasts
out of the files; I missed a real
comedy while I was in Africa."</p>

<p>Winstein nodded. "We got pretty
good coverage on it, but our worthy
competitor, whose name I will not
have mentioned within these sacred
halls, got Beebee Vayne to run a
commentary on it, and we got beat
out on the meters."</p>

<p>"Vayne?" Elshawe was still grinning.
"That's a new twist&mdash;getting a
comedian to do a news report."</p>

<p>"I'll have to admit that my worthy
competitor, whose name et cetera,
does get an idea once in a while. But
I don't want him beating us out
again. We're in on the ground floor
this time, and I want to hog the
whole thing if I can."</p>

<p>"Sounds like a great idea, if we
can swing it," Elshawe agreed. "Do
you have a new gimmick? You're not
going to get a comedian to do it, are
you?"</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid! Even if it had
been my own idea three years ago,
I wouldn't repeat it, and I certainly
won't have it said that I copy my
competitors. No, what I want you
to do is go out there and find out
what's going on. Get a full background
on it. We'll figure out the
presentation angle when we get some
idea of what he's going to do this
time." Winstein eased himself off the
corner of Elshawe's desk and stood
up. "By the way&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yeah?"</p>

<p>"Play it straight when you go out
there. You're a reporter, looking for
news; you haven't made any previous
judgments."</p>

<p>Elshawe's pipe had gone out. He
fired it up again with his desk lighter.
"I don't want to be," he said
between puffs, "too cagey. If he's
got ... any brains ... he'll know
it's ... a phony act ... if I overdo
it." He snapped off the lighter and
looked at his employer through a
cloud of blue-gray smoke. "I mean,
after all, he's on the records as being
a crackpot. I'd be a pretty
stupid reporter if I believed everything
he said. If I don't act a little
skeptical, he'll think I'm either a
blockhead or a phony or both."</p>

<p>"Maybe," Winstein said doubtfully.
"Still, some of these crackpots fly
off the handle if you doubt their
word in the least bit."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'll do," Elshawe
said. "He used to live here
in New York, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"Still does," Winstein said. "He
has a two-floor apartment on Central
Park West. He just uses that New
Mexico ranch of his for relaxation."</p>

<p>"He's not hurting for money, is
he?" Elshawe asked at random.
"Anyway, what I'll do is look up
some of the people he knows and
get an idea of what kind of a bird
he is. Then, when I get out there,
I'll know more what kind of line to
feed him."</p>

<p>"That sounds good. But whatever
you do, play it on the soft side. My
confidential informant tells me that
the only reason we're getting this inside
info is because Malcom Porter
is sore about the way our competition
treated him four years ago."</p>

<p>"Just who is this confidential informant,
anyway, Ole?" Elshawe asked
curiously.</p>

<p>Winstein grinned widely. "It's
supposed to be very confidential. I
don't want it to get any further than
you."</p>

<p>"Sure not. Since when am I a
blabbermouth? Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Malcom Porter."</p>

<hr />

<p>Two days later, Terrence Elshawe
was sitting in the front seat of a big
station wagon, watching the scenery
go by and listening to the driver
talk as the machine tooled its way
out of Silver City, New Mexico, and
headed up into the Mogollon Mountains.</p>

<p>"Was a time, not too long back,"
the driver was saying, "when a man
couldn't get up into this part of the
country 'thout a pack mule. Still
places y'can't, but the boss had t'
have a road built up to the ranch
so's he could bring in all that heavy
equipment. Reckon one of these days
the Mogollons 'll be so civilized and
full a people that a fella might as
well live in New York."</p>

<p>Elshawe, who hadn't seen another
human being for fifteen minutes, felt
that the predicted overcrowding was
still some time off.</p>

<p>"'Course," the driver went on, "I
reckon folks have t' live some place,
but I never could see why human
bein's are so all-fired determined to
bunch theirselves up so thick together
that they can't hardly move&mdash;like
a bunch of sheep in a snowstorm.
It don't make sense to me.
Does it to you, Mr. Skinner?"</p>

<p>That last was addressed to the
other passenger, an elderly man who
was sitting in the seat behind Elshawe.</p>

<p>"I guess it's pretty much a matter
of taste, Bill," Mr. Skinner said in a
soft voice.</p>

<p>"I reckon," Bill said, in a tone
that implied that anyone whose
tastes were so bad that he wanted to
live in the city was an object of pity
who probably needed psychiatric
treatment. He was silent for a moment,
in obvious commiseration with
his less fortunate fellows.</p>

<p>Elshawe took the opportunity to
try to get a word in. The chunky
Westerner had picked him up at the
airport, along with Mr. Samuel Skinner,
who had come in on the same
plane with Elshawe, and, after introducing
himself as Bill Rodriguez, he
had kept up a steady stream of chatter
ever since. Elshawe didn't feel he
should take a chance on passing up
the sudden silence.</p>

<p>"By the way; has Mr. Porter applied
to the Government for permission
to test his ... uh ... his ship,
yet?"</p>

<p>Bill Rodriguez didn't take his eyes
off the winding road. "Well, now, I
don't rightly know, Mr. Elshawe.
Y'see, I just work on the ranch up
there. I don't have a doggone thing
to do with the lab'r'tory at all&mdash;'cept
to keep the fence in good shape so's
the stock don't get into the lab'r'tory
area. If Mr. Porter wants me to
know somethin', he tells me, an' if
he don't, why, I don't reckon it's
any a my business."</p>

<p>"I see," said Elshawe. <i>And that
shuts</i> me <i>up</i>, he thought to himself.
He took out his pipe and began to
fill it in silence.</p>

<p>"How's everything out in Los
Angeles, Mr. Skinner?" Rodriguez
asked the passenger in back. "Haven't
seen you in quite a spell."</p>

<p>Elshawe listened to the conversation
between the two with half an
ear and smoked his pipe wordlessly.</p>

<p>He had spent the previous day
getting all the information he could
on Malcom Porter, and the information
hadn't been dull by any means.</p>

<p>Porter had been born in New York
in 1949, which made him just barely
thirty-three. His father, Vanneman
Porter, had been an oddball in his
own way, too. The Porters of New
York didn't quite date back to the
time of Peter Stuyvesant, but they
had been around long enough to acquire
the feeling that the twenty-four
dollars that had been paid for Manhattan
Island had come out of the
family exchequer. Just as the Vanderbilts
looked upon the Rockefellers
as newcomers, so the Porters looked
on the Vanderbilts.</p>

<p>For generations, it had been tacitly
conceded that a young Porter gentleman
had only three courses of
action open to him when it came
time for him to choose his vocation
in life. He could join the firm of
Porter &amp; Sons on Wall Street, or he
could join some other respectable
business or banking enterprise, or he
could take up the Law. (Corporation
law, of course&mdash;<i>never</i> criminal law.)
For those few who felt that the business
world was not for them, there
was a fourth alternative&mdash;studying
for the priesthood of the Episcopal
Church. Anything else was unheard
of.</p>

<p>So it had been somewhat of a
shock to Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton Porter
when their only son, Vanneman,
had announced that he intended to
study physics at M.I.T. But they
gave their permission; they were
quite certain that the dear boy would
"come to his senses" and join the
firm after he had been graduated.
He was, after all, the only one to
carry on the family name and manage
the family holdings.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/003.png" width="600" height="361" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>But Vanneman Porter not only
stuck to his guns and went on to a
Ph.D.; he compounded his delinquency
by marrying a pretty, sweet,
but not overly bright girl named
Mary Kelley.</p>

<p>Malcom Porter was their son.</p>

<hr />

<p>When Malcom was ten years old,
both his parents were killed in a
smashup on the New Jersey Turnpike,
and the child went to live with
his widowed grandmother, Mrs.
Hamilton Porter.</p>

<p>Terry Elshawe had gathered that
young Malcom Porter's life had not
been exactly idyllic from that point
on. Grandmother Porter hadn't approved
of her son's marriage, and
she seemed to have felt that she
must do everything in her power to
help her grandson overcome the
handicap of having nonaristocratic
blood in his veins.</p>

<p>Elshawe wasn't sure in his own
mind whether environment or heredity
had been the deciding factor in
Malcom Porter's subsequent life, but
he had a hunch that the two had
been acting synergistically. It was
likely that the radical change in his
way of life after his tenth year had
as much to do with his behavior as
the possibility that the undeniably
brilliant mental characteristics of the
Porter family had been modified by
the genes of the pretty but scatter-brained
wife of Vanneman Porter.</p>

<p>Three times, only his grandmother's
influence kept him from being
expelled from the exclusive prep
school she had enrolled him in, and
his final grades were nothing to
mention in polite society, much less
boast about.</p>

<p>In her own way, the old lady was
trying to do her best for him, but
she had found it difficult to understand
her own son, and his deviations
from the Porter norm had been
slight in comparison with those of
his son. When the time came for
Malcom to enter college, Grandmother
Porter was at a total loss as to
what to do. With his record, it was
unlikely that any law school would
take him unless he showed tremendous
improvement in his pre-law
courses. And unless that improvement
was a general one, not only as far
as his studies were concerned, but
in his handling of his personal life,
it would be commercial suicide to
put him in any position of trust with
Porter &amp; Sons. It wasn't that he was
dishonest; he simply couldn't be
trusted to do anything properly. He
had a tendency to follow his own
whims and ignore everybody else.</p>

<p>The idea of his entering the
clergy was never even considered.</p>

<p>It came almost as a relief to the
old woman when Malcom announced
that he was going to study physics,
as his father had done.</p>

<p>The relief didn't last long. By the
time Malcom was in his sophomore
year, he was apparently convinced
that his instructors were dunderheads
to the last man. That, Elshawe
thought, was probably not unusual
among college students, but Malcom
Porter made the mistake of telling
them about it.</p>

<p>One of the professors with whom
Elshawe had talked had said: "He
acted as though he owned the college.
That, I think, was what was
his trouble in his studies; he wasn't
really stupid, and he wasn't as lazy
as some said, but he didn't want to
be bothered with anything that he
didn't enjoy. The experiments he
liked, for instance, were the showy,
spectacular ones. He built himself a
Tesla coil, and a table with hidden
AC electromagnets in it that would
make a metal plate float in the air.
But when it came to nucleonics, he
was bored. Anything less than a
thermonuclear bomb wasn't any
fun."</p>

<p>The trouble was that he called his
instructors stupid and dull for being
interested in "commonplace
stuff," and it infuriated him to be
forced to study such "junk."</p>

<p>As a result, he managed to get
himself booted out of college toward
the end of his junior year. And that
was the end of his formal education.</p>

<p>Six months after that, his grandmother
died. Although she had married
into the Porter family, she was
fiercely proud of the name; she had
been born a Van Courtland, so she
knew what family pride was. And
the realization that Malcom was the
last of the Porters&mdash;and a failure&mdash;was
more than she could bear. The
coronary attack she suffered should
have been cured in a week, but the
best medico-surgical techniques on
Earth can't help a woman who
doesn't want to live.</p>

<p>Her will showed exactly what she
thought of Malcom Porter. The Porter
holdings were placed in trust.
Malcom was to have the earnings,
but he had no voice whatever in control
of the principal until he was
fifty years of age.</p>

<hr />

<p>Instead of being angry, Malcom
was perfectly happy. He had an income
that exceeded a million dollars
before taxes, and didn't need to
worry about the dull details of making
money. He formed a small corporation
of his own, Porter Research
Associates, and financed it with his
own money. It ran deep in the red,
but Porter didn't mind; Porter Research
Associates was a hobby, not
a business, and running at a deficit
saved him plenty in taxes.</p>

<p>By the time he was twenty-five, he
was known as a crackpot. He had a
motley crew of technicians and scientists
working for him&mdash;some with
Ph.D.'s, some with a trade-school
education. The personnel turnover in
that little group was on a par with
the turnover of patients in a maternity
ward, at least as far as genuine
scientists were concerned. Porter
concocted theories and hypotheses out
of cobwebs and became furious with
anyone who tried to tear them down.
If evidence came up that would tend
to show that one of his pet theories
was utter hogwash, he'd come up
with an <i>ad hoc</i> explanation which
showed that this particular bit of
evidence was an exception. He insisted
that "the basis of science lies
in the experimental evidence, not in
the pronouncements of authorities,"
which meant that any recourse to
the theories of Einstein, Pauli, Dirac,
Bohr, or Fermi was as silly as quoting
Aristotle, Plato, or St. Thomas
Aquinas. The only authority he would
accept was Malcom Porter.</p>

<p>Nobody who had had any training
in science could work long with a
man like that, even if the pay had
been high, which it wasn't. The only
people who could stick with him
were the skilled workers&mdash;the welders,
tool-and-die men, electricians,
and junior engineers, who didn't care
much about theories as long as they
got the work done. They listened
respectfully to what Porter had to
say and then built the gadgets he told
them to build. If the gadgets didn't
work the way Porter expected them
to, Porter would fuss and fidget with
them until he got tired of them, then
he would junk them and try something
else. He never blamed a technician
who had followed orders.
Since the salaries he paid were proportional
to the man's "ability and
loyalty"&mdash;judged, of course, by Porter's
own standards&mdash;he soon had a
group of technician-artisans who
knew that their personal security
rested with Malcom Porter, and that
personal loyalty was more important
than the ability to utilize the scientific
method.</p>

<p>Not everything that Porter had
done was a one-hundred-per cent
failure. He had managed to come up
with a few basic improvements, patented
them, and licensed them out
to various manufacturers. But these
were purely an accidental by-product.
Malcom Porter was interested
in "basic research" and not much
else, it seemed.</p>

<p>He had written papers and books,
but they had been uniformly rejected
by the scientific journals, and those
he had had published himself were
on a par with the writings of Immanuel
Velikovsky and George
Adamski.</p>

<p>And now he was going to shoot a
rocket&mdash;or whatever it was&mdash;to the
moon. Well, Elshawe thought, if it
went off as scheduled, it would at
least be worth watching. Elshawe
was a rocket buff; he'd watched a
dozen or more moon shots in his life&mdash;everything
from the automatic
supply-carriers to the three-man passenger
rockets that added to the personnel
of Moon Base One&mdash;and he
never tired of watching the bellowing
monsters climb up skywards on
their white-hot pillars of flame.</p>

<p>And if nothing happened, Elshawe
decided, he'd at least get a laugh
out of the whole episode.</p>

<hr />

<p>After nearly two hours of driving,
Bill Rodriguez finally turned off the
main road onto an asphalt road that
climbed steeply into the pine forest
that surrounded it. A sign said:
<i>Double Horseshoe Ranch&mdash;Private
Road&mdash;No Trespassing</i>.</p>

<p>Elshawe had always thought of a
ranch as a huge spread of flat
prairie land full of cattle and gun-toting
cowpokes on horseback; a
mountainside full of sheep just
didn't fit into that picture.</p>

<p>After a half mile or so, the station
wagon came to a high metal-mesh
fence that blocked the road. On the
big gate, another sign proclaimed
that the area beyond was private
property and that trespassers would
be prosecuted.</p>

<p>Bill Rodriguez stopped the car,
got out, and walked over to the gate.
He pressed a button in one of the
metal gateposts and said, "Ed?
This's Bill. I got Mr. Skinner and
that New York reporter with me."</p>

<p>After a slight pause, there was a
metallic click, and the gate swung
open. Rodriguez came back to the
car, got in, and drove on through
the gate. Elshawe twisted his head
to watch the big gate swing shut behind
them.</p>

<p>After another ten minutes, Rodriguez
swung off the road onto another
side road, and ten minutes after
that the station wagon went over a
small rise and headed down into a
small valley. In the middle of it,
shining like bright aluminum in the
sun, was a vessel.</p>

<p><i>Now I know Porter is nuts</i>, Elshawe
thought wryly.</p>

<p>Because the vessel, whatever it
was, was parallel to the ground,
looking like the fuselage of a stratojet,
minus wings and tail, sitting on
its landing gear. Nowhere was there
any sign of a launching pad, with
its gantries and cranes and jet baffles.
Nor was there any sign of a rocket
motor on the vessel itself.</p>

<p>As the station wagon approached
the cluster of buildings a hundred
yards this side of the machine, Elshawe
realized with shock that the
thing <i>was</i> a stripped-down stratojet&mdash;an
old Grumman <i>Supernova</i>, <i>circa</i>
1970.</p>

<p>"Well, Elijah got there by sitting
in an iron chair and throwing a magnet
out in front of himself," Elshawe
said, "so what the hell."</p>

<p>"What?" Rodriguez asked blankly.</p>

<p>"Nothing; just thinking out loud.
Sorry."</p>

<p>Behind Elshawe, Mr. Skinner
chuckled softly, but said nothing.</p>

<p>When the station wagon pulled up
next to one of the cluster of white
prefab buildings, Malcom Porter
himself stepped out of the wide door
and walked toward them.</p>

<p>Elshawe recognized the man from
his pictures&mdash;tall, wide-shouldered,
dark-haired, and almost handsome,
he didn't look much like a wild-eyed
crackpot. He greeted Rodriguez and
Skinner rather peremptorily, but he
smiled broadly and held out his hand
to Elshawe.</p>

<p>"Mr. Elshawe? I'm Malcom Porter."
His grip was firm and friendly.
"I'm glad to see you. Glad you could
make it."</p>

<p>"Glad to be here, Dr. Porter," Elshawe
said in his best manner. "It's
quite a privilege." He knew that
Porter liked to be called "Doctor";
all his subordinates called him that.</p>

<p>But, surprisingly, Porter said:
"Not 'Doctor,' Mr. Elshawe; just
'Mister.' My boys like to call me
'Doctor,' but it's sort of a nickname.
I don't have a degree, and I don't
claim one. I don't want the public
thinking I'm claiming to be something
I'm not."</p>

<p>"I understand, Mr. Porter."</p>

<p>Bill Rodriguez's voice broke in.
"Where do you want me to put all
this stuff, Doc?" He had unloaded
Elshawe's baggage from the station
wagon and set it carefully on the
ground. Skinner picked up his single
suitcase and looked at Porter inquiringly.</p>

<p>"My usual room, Malcom?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. Sure, Sam; sure." As Skinner
walked off toward one of the
other buildings, Porter said: "Quite
a load of baggage you have there,
Mr. Elshawe. Recording equipment?"</p>

<p>"Most of it," the reporter admitted.
"Recording TV cameras, 16mm
movie cameras, tape recorders, 35mm
still cameras&mdash;the works. I wanted
to get good coverage, and if you've
got any men that you won't be using
during the take-off, I'd like to borrow
them to help me operate this stuff."</p>

<p>"Certainly; certainly. Come on,
Bill, let's get this stuff over to Mr.
Elshawe's suite."</p>

<hr />

<p>The suite consisted of three
rooms, all very nicely appointed for
a place as far out in the wilderness
as this. When Elshawe got his equipment
stowed away, Porter invited him
to come out and take a look at his
pride and joy.</p>

<p>"The first real spaceship, Elshawe,"
he said energetically. "The first real
spaceship. The rocket is no more a
spaceship than a rowboat is an ocean-going
vessel." He gestured toward
the sleek, shining, metal ship. "Of
course, it's only a pilot model, you
might say. I don't have hundreds of
millions of dollars to spend; I had
to make do with what I could afford.
That's an old Grumman <i>Supernova</i>
stratojet. I got it fairly cheap because
I told 'em I didn't want the engines
or the wings or the tail assembly.</p>

<p>"But she'll do the job, all right.
Isn't she a beauty?"</p>

<p>Elshawe had his small pocket recorder
going; he might as well get
all this down. "Mr. Porter," he asked
carefully, "just how does this
vessel propel itself? I understand
that, at the trial, it was said that you
claimed it was an antigravity device,
but that you denied it."</p>

<p>"Those idiots!" Porter exploded
angrily. "Nobody understood what I
was talking about because they
wouldn't listen! Antigravity! <i>Pfui!</i>
When they learned how to harness
electricity, did they call it anti-electricity?
When they built the first
atomic reactor, did they call it anti-atomic
energy? A rocket works
against gravity, but they don't call
<i>that</i> antigravity, do they? My device
works <i>with</i> gravity, not against
it."</p>

<p>"What sort of device is it?" Elshawe
asked.</p>

<p>"I call it the Gravito-Inertial Differential
Polarizer," Porter said importantly.</p>

<p>Elshawe was trying to frame his
next question when Porter said: "I
know the name doesn't tell you
much, but then, names never do, do
they? You know what a transformer
does, but what does the name by
itself convey? Nothing, unless you
know what it does in the first place.
A cyclotron cycles something, but
what? A broadcaster casts something
abroad&mdash;what? And how?"</p>

<p>"I see. And the 'how' and 'what'
is your secret, eh?"</p>

<p>"Partly. I can give you a little information,
though. Suppose there
were only one planet in all space,
and you were standing on its surface.
Could you tell if the planet were
spinning or not? And, if so, how
fast? Sure you could; you could
measure the so-called centrifugal
force. The same thing goes for a
proton or electron or neutron or even
a neutrino. But, if it <i>is</i> spinning,
what is the spin relative to? To the
particle itself? That's obvious nonsense.
Therefore, what is commonly
called 'inertia' is as much a property
of so-called 'empty space' as it is a
property of matter. My device simply
utilizes spatial inertia by polarizing it
against the matter inertia of the ship,
that's all."</p>

<p>"Hm-m-m," said Elshawe. As far
as his own knowledge of science
went, that statement made no sense
whatever. But the man's manner was
persuasive. Talking to him, Elshawe
began to have the feeling that Porter
not only knew what he was talking
about, but could actually do what he
said he was going to do.</p>

<p>"What's that?" Porter asked
sharply, looking up into the sky.</p>

<p>Elshawe followed his gaze. "That"
was a Cadillac aircar coming over a
ridge in the distance, its fans making
an ever-louder throaty hum as it approached.
It settled down to an altitude
of three feet as it neared, and
floated toward them on its cushion
of air. On its side, Elshawe could see
the words, UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT,
and beneath that, in
smaller letters, <i>Civil Aeronautics Authority</i>.</p>

<p>"Now what?" Porter muttered
softly. "I haven't notified anyone of
my intentions yet&mdash;not officially."</p>

<p>"Sometimes those boys don't wait
for official notification," Elshawe said.</p>

<p>Porter glanced at him, his eyes
narrowed. "You didn't say anything,
did you?"</p>

<p>"Look, Mr. Porter, I don't play
that way," Elshawe said tightly. "As
far as I'm concerned, this is your
show; I'm just here to get the story.
You did us a favor by giving us advance
notice; why should we louse
up your show for you?"</p>

<p>"Sorry," Porter said brusquely.
"Well, let's make a good show of
it."</p>

<p>The CAA aircar slowed to a halt,
its fans died, and it settled to its
wheels.</p>

<hr />

<p>Two neatly dressed, middle-aged
men climbed out. Both were carrying
briefcases. Porter walked briskly toward
them, a warm smile on his face;
Elshawe tagged along behind. The
CAA men returned Porter's smile
with smiles that could only be called
polite and businesslike.</p>

<p>Porter performed the introductions,
and the two men identified themselves
as Mr. Granby and Mr. Feldstein,
of the Civil Aeronautics Authority.</p>

<p>"Can I help you, gentlemen?"
Porter asked.</p>

<p>Granby, who was somewhat shorter,
fatter, and balder than his partner,
opened his briefcase. "We're
just here on a routine check, Mr.
Porter. If you can give us a little
information...?" He let the half-question
hang in the air as he took
a sheaf of papers from his briefcase.</p>

<p>"Anything I can do to help," Porter
said.</p>

<p>Granby, looking at the papers,
said: "In 1979, I believe you purchased
a Grumman <i>Supernova</i> jet
powered aircraft from Trans-American
Airlines? Is that correct?"</p>

<p>"That is correct," Porter agreed.</p>

<p>Granby handed one of the papers
to Porter. "That is a copy of the
registration certificate. Is the registration
number the same as it is on your
copy?"</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/004.png" width="159" height="500" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"I believe so," Porter said, looking
at the number. "Yes, I'm sure it
is."</p>

<p>Granby nodded briskly. "According
to our records, the machine was
sold as scrap. That is to say, it was
not in an airworthy condition. It
was, in fact, sold without the engines.
Is that correct?"</p>

<p>"Correct."</p>

<p>"May I ask if you still own the
machine in question?"</p>

<p>Porter gave the man a look that
accused Granby of being stupid or
blind or both. He pointed to the
hulking fuselage of the giant aircraft.
"There it is."</p>

<p>Granby and Feldstein both turned
to look at it as though they had
never noticed it before. "Ah, yes,"
Granby said, turning back. "Well,
that's about all there is to it." He
looked at his partner. "It's obvious
that there's no violation here, eh,
Feldstein?"</p>

<p>"Quite," said Feldstein in a staccato
voice.</p>

<p>"Violation?" Porter asked. "What
violation?"</p>

<p>"Well, nothing, really," Granby
said, deprecatingly. "Just routine, as
I said. People have been known to
buy aircraft as scrap and then repair
them and re-outfit them."</p>

<p>"Is that illegal?" Porter asked.</p>

<p>"No, no," said Granby hastily.
"Of course not. But any ship so re-outfitted
and repaired must pass CAA
inspection before it can leave the
ground, you understand. So we keep
an eye on such transactions to make
sure that the law isn't violated."</p>

<p>"After three years?" Porter asked
blandly.</p>

<p>"Well ... ah ... well ...
you know how it is," Granby said
nervously. "These things take time.
Sometimes ... due to ... clerical
error, we overlook a case now and
then." He glanced at his partner,
then quickly looked back at Porter.</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, Mr. Porter,"
Feldstein said in a flat, cold
voice, "in view of your record, we
felt that the investigation at this
time was advisable. You bought a
scrap missile and used it illegally.
You can hardly blame us for looking
into this matter."</p>

<p>"No," said Porter. He had transferred
his level gaze to the taller of
the two men, since it had suddenly
become evident that Feldstein, not
Granby, was the stronger of the two.</p>

<p>"However," Feldstein went on,
"I'm glad to see that we have no
cause for alarm. You're obviously not
fitting that up as an aircraft. By the
way&mdash;just out of curiosity&mdash;what
<i>are</i> you doing with it?" He turned
around to look at the big fuselage
again.</p>

<p>Porter sighed. "I had intended to
hold off on this for a few days, but
I might as well let the cat out now.
I intend to take off in that ship this
week end."</p>

<hr />

<p>Granby's eyes opened wide, and
Feldstein spun around as though
someone had jabbed him with a
needle. "<i>What?</i>"</p>

<p>Porter simply repeated what he
had said. "I had intended to make
application to the Space Force for
permission to test it," he added.</p>

<p>Feldstein looked at him blankly
for a moment.</p>

<p>Then: "The <i>Space</i> Force? Mr.
Porter, civilian aircraft come under
the jurisdiction of the CAA."</p>

<p>"How's he going to fly it?" Granby
asked. "No engines, no wings, no
control surfaces. It's silly."</p>

<p>"Rocket motors in the rear, of
course," said Feldstein. "He's converted
the thing into a rocket."</p>

<p>"But the tail is closed," Granby
objected. "There's no rocket orifice."</p>

<p>"Dummy cover, I imagine," Feldstein
said. "Right, Mr. Porter?"</p>

<p>"Wrong," said Porter angrily.
"The motive power is supplied by a
mechanism of my own devising! It
has nothing to do with rockets! It's
as superior to rocket power as the
electric motor is to the steam engine!"</p>

<p>Feldstein and Granby glanced at
each other, and an almost identical
expression of superior smugness grew
over their features. Feldstein looked
back at Porter and said, "Mr. Porter,
I assure you that it doesn't matter
what you're using to lift that thing.
You could be using dynamite for all
I care. The law says that it can't
leave the ground unless it's airworthy.
Without wings or control
surfaces, it is obviously not airworthy.
If it is not a rocket device,
then it comes under the jurisdiction
of the Civil Aeronautics Authority,
and if you try to take off without
our permission, you'll go to jail.</p>

<p>"If it <i>is</i> a rocket device, then it
will be up to the Space Force to inspect
it before take-off to make sure
it is not dangerous.</p>

<p>"I might remind you, Mr. Porter,
that you are on parole. You still have
three years to serve on your last conviction.
I wouldn't play around with
rockets any more if I were you."</p>

<p>Porter blew up. "Listen, you! I'm
not going to be pushed around by
you or anyone else! I know better
than you do what Alcatraz is like,
and I'm not going back there if I
can help it. This country is still
Constitutionally a democracy, not a
bureaucracy, and I'm going to see to
it that I get to exercise my rights!</p>

<p>"I've invented something that's as
radically new as ... as ... as the Law
of Gravity was in the Seventeenth
Century! And I'm going to get recognition
for it, understand me?" He
gestured furiously toward the fuselage
of the old <i>Supernova</i>. "That ship
is not only airworthy, but <i>space</i>worthy!
And it's a thousand times
safer and a thousand times better
than any rocket will ever be!</p>

<p>"For your information, Mister
Smug-Face, I've already flown her!"</p>

<p>Porter stopped, took a deep
breath, compressed his lips, and then
said, in a lower, somewhat calmer
tone, "Know what she'll do? That
baby will hang in the air just like
your aircar, there&mdash;and without benefit
of those outmoded, power-wasting
blower fans, too.</p>

<p>"Now, understand me, Mr. Feldstein:
I'm not going to break any
laws unless I have to. You and all
your bureaucrat friends will have a
chance to give me an O.K. on this
test. But I warn you, brother&mdash;<i>I'm
going to take that ship up!</i>"</p>

<hr />

<p>Feldstein's jaw muscles had tightened
at Porter's tone when he began,
but he had relaxed by the time the
millionaire had finished, and was
even managing to look smugly tolerant.
Elshawe had thumbed the button on
his minirecorder when the conversation
had begun, and he was chuckling
mentally at the thought of what
was going down on the thin, magnetite-impregnated,
plastic thread
that was hissing past the recording
head.</p>

<p>Feldstein said: "Mr. Porter, we
came here to remind you of the law,
nothing more. If you intend to abide
by the law, fine and dandy. If not,
you'll go back to prison.</p>

<p>"That ship is not airworthy,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How do you know it isn't?" Porter
roared.</p>

<p>"By inspection, Mr. Porter; by
inspection." Feldstein looked exasperated.
"We have certain standards
to go by, and an aircraft without
wings or control surfaces simply
doesn't come up to those standards,
that's all. Even a rocket has to have
stabilizing fins." He paused and zipped
open his briefcase.</p>

<p>"In view of your attitude," he
said, pulling out a paper, "I'm afraid
I shall have to take official steps.
This is to notify you that the aircraft
in question has been inspected and
found to be not airworthy. Since&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!" Porter snapped.
"Who are you to say so? How would
you know?"</p>

<p>"I happen to be an officer of the
CAA," said Feldstein, obviously trying
to control his temper. "I also
happen to be a graduate aeronautical
engineer. If you wish, I will give
the ... the ... aircraft a thorough
inspection, inside and out,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Porter. His voice
and his manner had suddenly become
very gentle. "I don't think that would
do much good, do you?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that you'd condemn the
ship, no matter what you found inside.
You couldn't O.K. a ship without
airfoils, could you?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Feldstein,
"that's obvious, in the face of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right, then give me the notification
and forget the rest of the
inspection." Porter held out his hand.</p>

<p>Feldstein hesitated. "Well, now,
without a complete inspection&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again Porter interrupted. "You're
not going to get a complete inspection,
Buster," he said with a wolfish
grin. "Either serve that paper or get
off my back."</p>

<p>Feldstein slammed the paper into
Porter's hand. "That's your official
notification! If necessary, Mr. Porter,
we will be back with a Federal marshal!
Good day, Mr. Porter. Let's
go, Granby."</p>

<p>The two of them marched back
to their aircar and climbed inside.
The car lifted with a roar of blowers
and headed back over the mountains
toward Albuquerque.</p>

<p>But long before they were out of
sight over the ridge, Malcom Porter
had turned on his heel and started
back toward the cluster of buildings.
He was swearing vilely in a rumbling
monotone, and had apparently
forgotten all about Elshawe.</p>

<p>The reporter followed in silence
for a dozen paces, then he asked:
"What's your next step, Mr. Porter?"</p>

<p>Porter came to an abrupt stop,
turned, and looked at Elshawe. "I'm
going to phone General Fitzsimmons
in Washington! I'm&mdash;" He stopped,
scowling. "No, I guess I'd better
phone my lawyer first. I'll find out
what they can do and what they
can't." Then he turned again and
strode rapidly toward the nearest of
the buildings.</p>

<hr />

<p>Seventy-two hours later, Terry Elshawe
was in Silver City, talking to
his boss over a long-distance line.</p>

<p>"... And that's the way it lines
up, Ole. The CAA won't clear his
ship for take-off, and the Space Force
won't either. And if he tries it without
the O.K. of both of them, he'll
be right back in Alcatraz."</p>

<p>"He hasn't violated his parole
yet, though?" Winstein's voice came
distantly.</p>

<p>"No." Elshawe cursed the fact
that he couldn't get a vision connection
with New York. "But, the way
he's acting, he's likely to. He's furious."</p>

<p>"Why wouldn't he let the Space
Force officers look over his ship?"
Winstein asked. "I still don't see
how that would have hurt him if
he's really got something."</p>

<p>"It's on the recording I sent
you," Elshawe said.</p>

<p>"I haven't played it yet," Winstein
said. "Brief me."</p>

<p>"He wouldn't let the Space Force
men look at his engine or whatever
it is because he doesn't trust them,"
Elshawe said. "He claims to have
this new drive, but he doesn't want
anyone to go nosing around it. The
Space Force colonel ... what's his
name? ... Manetti, that's it. Manetti
asked Porter why, if he had a
new invention, he hadn't patented
it. Porter said that he wasn't going
to patent it because that would make
it available to every Tom, Dick, and
Harry&mdash;his very words&mdash;who wanted
to build it. Porter insists that,
since it's impossible to patent the
discovery of a new natural law, he
isn't going to give away his genius
for nothing. He said that Enrico
Fermi was the prime example of
what happened when the Government
got hold of something like
that when the individual couldn't
argue."</p>

<p>"Fermi?" Winstein asked puzzledly.
"Wasn't he a physicist or something,
back in the Forties?"</p>

<p>"Right. He's the boy who figured
out how to make the atomic bomb
practical. But the United States Government
latched onto it, and it took
him years to get any compensation.
He never did get the money that he
was entitled to.</p>

<p>"Porter says he wants to make
sure that the same thing doesn't happen
to him. He wants to prove that
he's got something and then let the
Government pay him what it's worth
and give him the recognition he deserves.
He says he has discovered a
new natural law and devised a machine
that utilizes that law. He isn't
going to let go of his invention until
he gets credit for everything."</p>

<p>There was a long silence from the
other end. After a minute, Elshawe
said: "Ole? You there?"</p>

<p>"Oh. Yeah ... sure. Just thinking.
Terry, what do you think of
this whole thing? Does Porter have
something?"</p>

<p>"Damned if I know. If I were in
New York, I'd say he was a complete
nut, but when I talk to him,
I'm halfway convinced that he
knows what he's talking about."</p>

<p>There was another long pause.
This time, Elshawe waited. Finally,
Oler Winstein said: "You think
Porter's likely to do something drastic?"</p>

<p>"Looks like it. The CAA has already
forbidden him to lift that ship.
The Space Force flatly told him that
he couldn't take off without permission,
and they said he wouldn't get
permission unless he let them look
over his gizmo ... whatever it
is."</p>

<p>"And he refused?"</p>

<p>"Well, he did let Colonel Manetti
look it over, but the colonel said
that, whatever the drive principle
was, it wouldn't operate a ship. He
said the engines didn't make any
sense. What it boils down to is that
the CAA thinks Porter has rockets
in the ship, and the Space Force
does, too. So they've both forbidden
him to take off."</p>

<p>"<i>Are</i> there any rocket motors in
the ship?" Winstein asked.</p>

<p>"Not as far as I can see," Elshawe
said. "He's got two big atomic-powered
DC generators aboard&mdash;says
they have to be DC to avoid electromagnetic
effects. But the drive engines
don't make any more sense to
me than they do to Colonel Manetti."</p>

<p>Another pause. Then: "O.K.,
Terry; you stick with it. If Porter
tries to buck the Government, we've
got a hell of a story if his gadget
works the way he says it does. If it
doesn't&mdash;which is more likely&mdash;then
we can still get a story when they
haul him back to the Bastille."</p>

<p>"Check-check. I'll call you if anything
happens."</p>

<hr />

<p>He hung up and stepped out of
the phone booth into the lobby of
the Murray Hotel. Across the lobby,
a glowing sign said <i>cocktail lounge</i>
in lower-case script.</p>

<p>He decided that a tall cool one
wouldn't hurt him any on a day like
this and ambled over, fumbling in
his pockets for pipe, tobacco pouch,
and other paraphernalia as he went.
He pushed open the door, spotted a
stool at the bar of the dimly-lit room,
went over to it and sat down.</p>

<p>He ordered his drink and had no
sooner finished than the man to his
left said, "Good afternoon, Mr. Elshawe."</p>

<p>The reporter turned his head toward
his neighbor. "Oh, hello, Mr.
Skinner. I didn't know you'd come
to town."</p>

<p>"I came in somewhat earlier.
Couple, three hours ago." His voice
had the careful, measured steadiness
of a man who has had a little too
much to drink and is determined not
to show it. That surprised Elshawe
a little; Skinner had struck him as a
middle-aged accountant or maybe
a high school teacher&mdash;the mild kind
of man who doesn't drink at all,
much less take a few too many.</p>

<p>"I'm going to hire a 'copter and
fly back," Elshawe said. "You're
welcome if you want to come along."</p>

<p>Skinner shook his head solemnly.
"No. Thank you. I'm going back
to Los Angeles this afternoon. I'm
just killing time, waiting for the local
plane to El Paso."</p>

<p>"Oh? Well, I hope you have a
good trip." Elshawe had been under
the impression that Skinner had come
to New Mexico solely to see the test
of Porter's ship. He had wondered
before how the man fitted into the
picture, and now he was wondering
why Skinner was leaving. He decided
he might as well try to find out.
"I guess you're disappointed because
the test has been called off," he said
casually.</p>

<p>"Called off? Hah. No such thing,"
Skinner said. "Not by a long shot.
Not Porter. He'll take the thing up,
and if the Army doesn't shoot him
down, the CAA will see to it that
he's taken back to prison. But that
won't stop him. Malcom Porter is
determined to go down in history
as a great scientist, and nothing is
going to stop him if he can help it."</p>

<p>"You think his spaceship will
work, then?"</p>

<p>"Work? Sure it'll work. It worked
in '79; it'll work now. The way that
drive is built, it can't help but work.
I just don't want to stick around
and watch him get in trouble again,
that's all."</p>

<p>Elshawe frowned. All the time
that Porter had been in prison, his
technicians had been getting together
the stuff to build the so-called
"spaceship," but none of them knew
how it was put together or how it
worked. Only Porter knew that, and
he'd put it together after he'd been
released on parole.</p>

<p>But if that was so, how come Skinner,
who didn't even work for Porter,
was so knowledgeable about the
drive? Or was that liquor talking?</p>

<p>"Did you help him build it?" the
reporter asked smoothly.</p>

<p>"<i>Help</i> him build it? Why, I&mdash;"
Then Skinner stopped abruptly.
"Why, no," he said after a moment.
"No. I don't know anything about it,
really. I just know that it worked in
'79, that's all." He finished his drink
and got off his stool. "Well, I've got
to be going. Nice talking to you.
Hope I see you again sometime."</p>

<p>"Sure. So long, Mr. Skinner." He
watched the man leave the bar.</p>

<p>Then he finished his own drink
and went back into the lobby and got
a phone. Ten minutes later, a friend
of his who was a detective on the Los
Angeles police force had promised to
check into Mr. Samuel Skinner. Elshawe
particularly wanted to know
what he had been doing in the past
three years and very especially what
he had been doing in the past year.
The cop said he'd find out. There was
probably nothing to it, Elshawe reflected,
but a reporter who doesn't
follow up accidentally dropped hints
isn't much of a reporter.</p>

<p>He came out of the phone booth,
fired up his pipe again, and strolled
back to the bar for one more drink
before he went back to Porter's ranch.</p>

<hr />

<p>Malcom Porter took one of the
darts from the half dozen he held in
his left hand and hurled it viciously
at the target board hung on the far
wall of the room.</p>

<p><i>Thunk!</i></p>

<p>"Four ring at six o'clock," he said
in a tight voice.</p>

<p><i>Thunk! Thunk! Thunk! Thunk!
Thunk!</i></p>

<p>The other five darts followed in
rapid succession. As he threw each
one, Porter snapped out a word.
"They ... can't ... stop ... Malcom
... Porter!" He glared at the
board "Two bull's-eyes; three fours,
and a three. Twenty-five points. You
owe me a quarter, Elshawe."</p>

<p>The reporter handed him a coin.
"Two bits it is. What can you do,
Porter? They've got you sewed up
tight. If you try to take off, they'll
cart you right back to The Rock&mdash;if
the Army doesn't shoot you down
first. Do you want to spend the next
ten years engrossed in the scenic beauties
of San Francisco Bay?"</p>

<p>"No. And I won't, either."</p>

<p>"Not if the Army gets you. I can
see the epitaph now:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">Malcom Porter, with vexation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thought he could defy the nation.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He shot for space with great elation&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now he's dust and radiation.<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="noin">Beneath it, they'll engrave a spaceship
argent with A-bombs rampant on a
field sable."</p>

<p>Porter didn't take offense. He grinned.
"What are you griping about? It
would make a great story."</p>

<p>"Sure it would," Elshawe agreed.
"But not for me. I don't write the
obituary column."</p>

<p>"You know what I like about you,
Elshawe?"</p>

<p>"Sure. I lose dart games to you."</p>

<p>"That, yes. But you really sound
worried. That means two things. One:
You like me. Two: You believe that
my ship actually will take off. That's
more than any of those other reporters
who have been prowling around
and phoning in do."</p>

<p>Elshawe shrugged silently and puffed
at his pipe. Malcom Porter's ego
was showing through. He was wrong
on two counts. Elshawe didn't like
him; the man's arrogance and his inflated
opinion of himself as a scientific
genius didn't sit well with the
reporter. And Elshawe didn't really
believe there was anything but a rocket
motor in that hull outside. A new,
more powerful kind of rocket perhaps&mdash;otherwise
Porter wouldn't be
trying to take a one-stage rocket to
the Moon. But a rocket, nonetheless.</p>

<p>"I don't want to go back to prison,"
Porter continued, "but I'll risk
that if I have to. But I won't risk
death just yet. Don't worry; the
Army won't know I'm even gone until
I'm halfway to the Moon."</p>

<p>"Foo!" said Elshawe. "Every radar
base from Albuquerque to the Mexican
border has an antenna focused on
the air above this ranch. The minute
you get above those mountains, they'll
have a fix on you, and a minute after
that, they'll have you bracketed with
Cobras.</p>

<p>"Why don't you let the Government
inspectors look it over and give
you an O.K.? What makes you think
they're all out to steal your invention?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they won't <i>steal</i> it," Porter
said bitterly. "Heaven's-to-Betsy <i>no</i>!
But this invention of mine will mean
that the United States of America will
be in complete control of the planets
and the space between. When the
Government wants a piece of property,
they try to buy it at their price;
if they can't do that, they condemn
it and pay the owner what they think
it's worth&mdash;not what the owner thinks
it's worth. The same thing applies
here; they'd give me what they
thought I ought to have&mdash;in ten years
or so. Look what happened to Fermi.</p>

<p>"No, Elshawe; when the Government
comes begging to me for this
invention, they can have it&mdash;on <i>my</i>
terms."</p>

<p>"Going to keep it a secret, eh? You
can't keep a thing like that secret.
Look what happened with atomic
energy after World War Two. We
kept it a secret from the Russians,
didn't we? Fine lot of good that did
us. As soon as they knew it was possible,
they went to work on it. Nature
answers any questions you ask her if
you ask her the right way. As soon
as the Government sees that your
spaceship works, they'll put some of
their bright physicists to work on it,
and you'll be in the same position
as you would have been if you'd
showed it to them in the first place.
Why risk your neck?"</p>

<p>Porter shook his head. "The analogy
isn't valid. Suppose someone had
invented the A-bomb in 1810. It
would have been a perfectly safe secret
because there wasn't a scientist
on Earth who included such a thing as
atomic energy in his philosophy. And,
believe me, this drive of mine is just
as far ahead of contemporary scientific
philosophy as atomic energy was
ahead of Napoleon's scientists.</p>

<p>"Suppose I told you that the fuel
my ship uses is a gas lighter than hydrogen.
It isn't, but suppose I told
you so. Do you think any scientist
today could figure out how it worked?
No. They <i>know</i> that there's no such
thing as a gas with a lighter atomic
weight than hydrogen. They know it
so well that they wouldn't even
bother to consider the idea.</p>

<p>"My invention is so far ahead of
present-day scientific thought that no
scientists except myself could have
even considered the idea."</p>

<p>"O.K.; O.K.," Elshawe said. "So
you're going to get yourself shot
down to prove your point."</p>

<p>Porter grinned lopsidedly. "Not at
all. You're still thinking in terms of
a rocket. Sure&mdash;if I used a rocket,
they'd knock me down fast, just as
soon as I lifted above the mountains.
But I don't have to do that. All I
have to do is get a few feet of altitude
and hug the ground all the way
to the Pacific coast. Once I get out
in the middle of the Pacific, I can
take off straight up without being
bothered at all."</p>

<p>"All right. If your machine will
do it," the reporter said, trying to
hide his skepticism.</p>

<p>"You still think I've got some kind
of rocket, don't you?" Porter asked
accusingly. He paused a moment,
then, as if making a sudden decision,
he said: "Look, Elshawe, I trust
you. I'm going to show you the inside
of that ship. I won't show you
my engines, but I <i>will</i> prove to you
that there are no rocket motors in
her. That way, when you write up
the story, you'll be able to say that
you have first-hand knowledge of that
fact. O.K.?"</p>

<p>"It's up to you," the reporter said.
"I'd like to see it."</p>

<p>"Come along," said Malcom Porter.</p>

<hr />

<p>Elshawe followed Porter out to
the field, feeling rather grateful that
he was getting something to work
on. They walked across the field,
past the two gun-toting men in Levis
that Porter had guarding the ship.
Overhead, the stars were shining
brightly through the thin mountain
air. Elshawe glanced at his wrist
watch. It was a little after ten p.m.</p>

<p>He helped Porter wheel the ramp
up to the door of the ship and then
followed him up the steps. Porter
unlocked the door and went inside.
The Grumman had been built to
cruise in the high stratosphere, so it
was as air-tight as a submarine.</p>

<p>Porter switched on the lights. "Go
on in."</p>

<p>The reporter stepped into the cabin
of the ship and looked around. It
had been rebuilt, all right; it didn't
look anything like the inside of a
normal stratojet.</p>

<p>"Elshawe."</p>

<p>"Yeah?" The reporter turned to
look at Porter, who was standing a
little behind him. He didn't even see
the fist that arced upward and smashed
into his jaw. All he saw was a
blaze of light, followed by darkness.</p>

<p>The next thing he knew, something
was stinging in his nostrils. He
jerked his head aside, coughing. The
smell came again. Ammonia.</p>

<p>"Wake up, Elshawe," Porter was
saying. "Have another whiff of these
smelling salts and you'll feel better."</p>

<p>Elshawe opened his eyes and looked
at the bigger man. "I'm awake.
Take that stuff away. What's the
idea of slugging me?"</p>

<p>"I was afraid you might not come
willingly," Porter said apologetically.
"I needed a witness, and I figured
you'd do better than anyone else."</p>

<p>Elshawe tried to move and found
that he was tied to the seat and
strapped in with a safety belt.
"What's this for?" he asked angrily.
His jaw still hurt.</p>

<p>"I'll take that stuff off in a few
minutes. I know I can trust you, but
I want you to remember that I'm the
only one who can pilot this ship. If
you try anything funny, neither one
of us will get back alive. I'll let you
go as soon as we get up to three hundred
miles."</p>

<p>Elshawe stared at him. "Where
are we?"</p>

<p>"Heading out toward mid-Pacific.
I headed south, to Mexico, first.
We're over open water now, headed
toward Baja California, so I put on
the autopilot. As soon as we get out
over the ocean, we can really make
time. You can watch the sun come
up in the west."</p>

<p>"And then?" Elshawe felt dazed.</p>

<p>"And then we head straight up.
For empty space."</p>

<p>Elshawe closed his eyes again. He
didn't even want to think about it.</p>

<hr />

<p>"... As you no doubt heard," Terrence
Elshawe dictated into the
phone, "Malcom Porter made good
his threat to take a spaceship of his
own devising to the Moon. Ham
radios all over North America picked
up his speech, which was made by
spreading the beam from an eighty-foot
diameter parabolic reflector and
aiming it at Earth from a hundred
thousand miles out. It was a collapsible
reflector, made of thin foil, like
the ones used on space stations. Paragraph.</p>

<p>"He announced that the trip was
made with the co-operation of the
United States Space Force, and that
it represented a major breakthrough
in the conquest of space. He&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just a sec," Winstein's voice
broke in. "Is that the truth? Was he
really working with the Space
Force?"</p>

<p>"Hell, no," said Elshawe. "But
they'll have to claim he was now.
Let me go on."</p>

<p>"Shoot."</p>

<p>"... He also beamed a message
to the men on Moon Base One, telling
them that from now on they
would be able to commute back and
forth from Luna to Earth, just as
simply as flying from New York to
Detroit. Paragraph.</p>

<p>"What followed was even more
astounding. At tremendous acceleration,
Malcom Porter and Terrence
Elshawe, your reporter, headed for
Mars. Inside Porter's ship, there is
no feeling of acceleration except for
a steady, one-gee pull which makes
the passenger feel as though he is
on an ordinary airplane, even though
the spaceship may be accelerating at
more than a hundred gravities. Paragraph.</p>

<p>"Porter's ship circled Mars, taking
photographs of the Red Planet&mdash;the
first close-ups of Mars to be
seen by the human race. Then, at
the same tremendous rate of speed,
Porter's ship returned to Earth. The
entire trip took less than thirty-six
hours. According to Porter, improved
ships should be able to cut that time
down considerably. Paragraph."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/005.png" width="600" height="459" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Have you got those pics?" Winstein
cut in.</p>

<p>"Sure. Porter gave me an exclusive
in return for socking me. It was
worth it. Remember back in the
Twenties, when the newspapermen
talked about a scoop? Well, we've
got the biggest scoop of the century."</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Winstein. "The
Government hasn't made any announcement
yet. Where's Porter?"</p>

<p>"Under arrest, where'd you think?
After announcing that he would land
on his New Mexico ranch, he did
just that. As soon as he stepped out,
a couple of dozen Government
agents grabbed him. Violation of
parole&mdash;he left the state without notifying
his parole officer. But they
couldn't touch me, and they knew
it.</p>

<p>"Here's another bit of news for
your personal information. A bomb
went off inside the ship after it landed
and blew the drive to smithereens.
The only information is inside Porter's
head. He's got the Government
where the short hair grows."</p>

<p>"Looks like it. See here, Terry;
you get all the information you can
and be back here by Saturday.
You're going to go on the Weekend
Report."</p>

<p>"Me? I'm no actor. Let Maxon
handle it."</p>

<p>"No. This is hot. You're an eye-witness.
Maxon will interview you.
Understand?"</p>

<p>"O.K.; you're the boss, Ole. Anything
else?"</p>

<p>"Not right now, but if anything
more comes up, call in."</p>

<p>"Right. 'Bye." He hung up and
leaned back in his chair, cocking his
feet up on the desk. It was Malcom
Porter's desk and Malcom Porter's
chair. He was sitting in the Big
Man's office, just as though he owned
it. His jaw still hurt a little, but he
loved every ache of it. It was hard
to remember that he had ever been
angry with Porter.</p>

<p>Just before they had landed, Porter
had said: "They'll arrest me, of
course. I knew that when I left. But
I think I can get out of it. There
will be various kinds of Government
agents all over the place, but they
won't find anything. I've burned all
my notebooks.</p>

<p>"I'll instruct my attorney that
you're to have free run of the place
so that you can call in your story."</p>

<hr />

<p>The phone rang. Elshawe grabbed
up the receiver and said: "Malcom
Porter's residence." He wished that
they had visiphones out in the country;
he missed seeing the face of the
person he was talking to.</p>

<p>"Let me talk to Mr. Terrence Elshawe,
please," said the voice at the
other end. "This is Detective Lieutenant
Martin of the Los Angeles
Police Department."</p>

<p>"This is me, Marty."</p>

<p>"Good! Boy, have I had trouble
getting to you! I had to make it an
official call before the phone company
would put the call through.
How does it feel to be notorious?"</p>

<p>"Great. What's new?"</p>

<p>"I got the dope on that Skinner
fellow. I suppose you still want it?
Or has success gone to your head?"</p>

<p>Elshawe had almost forgotten
about Skinner. "Shoot," he said.</p>

<p>The police officer rattled off Samuel
Skinner's vital statistics&mdash;age,
sex, date and place of birth, and so
on. Then: "He lived in New York
until 1977. Taught science for fifteen
years at a prep school there.
He&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a second," Elshawe interrupted.
"When was he born? Repeat
that."</p>

<p>"March fourth, nineteen-thirty."</p>

<p>"Fifty-three," Elshawe said, musingly.
"Older than he looks. O.K.;
go on."</p>

<p>"He retired in '77 and came to
L.A. to live. He&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Retired at the age of forty-seven?"
Elshawe asked incredulously.</p>

<p>"That's right. Not on a teacher's
pension, though. He's got some kind
of annuity from a New York life
insurance company. Pays pretty good,
too. He gets a check for two thousand
dollars on the third of every
month. I checked with his bank on
that. Nice, huh?"</p>

<p>"Very nice. Go on."</p>

<p>"He lives comfortably. No police
record. Quiet type. One servant, a
Chinese, lives with him. Sort of
combination of valet and secretary.</p>

<p>"As far as we can tell, he has
made four trips in the past three
years. One in June of '79, one in
June of '80, one in June of '81, and
this year he made the fourth one.
In '79, he went to Silver City, New
Mexico. In '80 and '81, he went to
Hawaii. This year, he went to Silver
City again. Mean anything to you?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," Elshawe said. "Are
you paying for this call, or is the
City of Los Angeles footing the
bill?"</p>

<p>"Neither. You are."</p>

<p>"Then shut up and let me think
for a minute." After less than a minute,
he said: "Martin, I want some
more data on that guy. I'm willing
to pay for it. Should I hire a private
detective?"</p>

<p>"That's up to you. I can't take
any money for it, naturally&mdash;but I'm
willing to nose around a little more
for you if I can. On the other hand,
I can't put full time in on it. There's
a reliable detective agency here in
L.A.&mdash; Drake's the guy's name.
Want me to get in touch with
him?"</p>

<p>"I'd appreciate it. Don't tell him
who wants the information or that
it has any connection with Porter.
Get&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold it, Terry ... just a second.
You know that if I uncover any indication
of a crime, all bets are off.
The information goes to my superiors,
not to you."</p>

<p>"I know. But I don't think there's
any crime involved. You work it
from your end and send me the bills.
O.K.?"</p>

<p>"Fair enough. What more do you
want?"</p>

<p>Elshawe told him.</p>

<p>When the phone call had been
completed, Elshawe sat back and
made clouds of pipe smoke, which he
stared at contemplatively. Then he
made two calls to New York&mdash;one
to his boss and another to a private
detective agency he knew he could
trust.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Malcom Porter case quickly
became a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>. Somebody
goofed. Handled properly, the whole
affair might have been hushed up;
the Government would have gotten
what it wanted, Porter would have
gotten what <i>he</i> wanted, and everyone
would have saved face. But some
bureaucrat couldn't see beyond the
outer surface of his spectacle lenses,
and some other bureaucrat failed to
stop the thing in time.</p>

<p>"Gall, gall, and bitter, bitter
wormwood," said Oler Winstein,
perching himself on the edge of
Terry Elshawe's desk.</p>

<p>"You don't Gallic, bitter, wormy,
or wooden. What's up?"</p>

<p>"Got a call from Senator Tallifero.
He wants to know if you'll consent
to appear before the Joint
Congressional Committee for Investigating
Military Affairs. I get the
feeling that if you say 'no,' they'll
send a formal invitation&mdash;something
on the order of a subpoena."</p>

<p>Elshawe sighed. "Oh, well. It's
news, anyway. When do they want
me to be in Washington?"</p>

<p>"Tomorrow. Meanwhile, Porter, of
course, is under arrest and in close
confinement. Confusion six ways
from Sunday." He shook his head.
"I don't understand why they just
didn't pat him on the back, say
they'd been working on this thing
all along, and cover it up fast."</p>

<p>"Too many people involved," Elshawe
said, putting his cold pipe in
the huge ashtray on his desk. "The
Civil Aeronautics crowd must have
had a spotter up in those mountains;
they had a warrant out for his arrest
within an hour after we took off.
They also notified the parole board,
who put out an all-points bulletin
immediately. The Army and the Air
Force were furious because he'd
evaded their radar net. Porter stepped
on so many toes so hard that it
was inevitable that one or more
would yell before they realized it
would be better to keep their mouths
shut."</p>

<p>"Well, you get up there and tell
your story, and I dare say he'll come
out of it."</p>

<p>"Sure he will. They know he's got
something, and they know they have
to have it. But he's going to go
through hell before they give it to
him."</p>

<p>Winstein slid off the desk and
stood up. "I hope so. He deserves
it. By the way, it's too bad you
couldn't get a story out of that Sam
Skinner character."</p>

<p>"Yeah. But there's nothing to it.
After all, even the FBI tried to find
out if there was anyone at all besides
Porter who might know anything
about it. No luck. Not even
the technicians who worked with
him knew anything useful. Skinner
didn't know anything at all." He told
the lie with a perfectly straight face.
He didn't like lying to Winstein, but
there was no other way. He hoped
he wouldn't have to lie to the Congressional
Committee; perjury was
not something he liked doing. The
trouble was, if he told the truth,
he'd be worse off than if he lied.</p>

<p>He took the plane that night for
Washington, and spent the next
three days answering questions while
he tried to keep his nerves under
control. Not once did they even approach
the area he wanted them to
avoid.</p>

<p>On the plane back, he relaxed,
closed his eyes, and, for the first
time in days, allowed himself to
think about Mr. Samuel Skinner.</p>

<hr />

<p>The reports from the two detective
agencies on the East and West
Coasts hadn't made much sense separately,
but together they added up
to enough to have made it worth
Elshawe's time to go to Los Angeles
and tackle Samuel Skinner personally.
He had called Skinner and
made an appointment; Skinner had
invited him out to his home.</p>

<p>It was a fairly big house, not too
new, and it sat in the middle of a lot
that was bigger than normal for land-hungry
Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Elshawe ran through the scene
mentally. He could see Skinner's
mild face and hear his voice saying:
"Come in, Mr. Elshawe."</p>

<p>They went into the living room,
and Skinner waved him toward a
chair. "Sit down. Want some coffee?"</p>

<p>"Thanks; I'd appreciate it." While
Skinner made coffee, the reporter
looked around the room. It wasn't
overly showy, but it showed a sort
of subdued wealth. It was obvious
that Mr. Skinner wasn't lacking in
comforts.</p>

<p>Skinner brought in the coffee and
then sat down, facing Elshawe, in
another chair. "Now," he said bluntly,
"what was that remark you made
on the phone about showing up Malcom
Porter as a phony? I understood
that you actually went to Mars on
his ship. Don't you believe the evidence
of your own senses?"</p>

<p>"I don't mean that kind of
phony," Elshawe said. "And you
know it. I'll come to the point. I
know that Malcom Porter didn't invent
the Gravito-Inertial Differential
Polarizer. <i>You</i> did."</p>

<p>Skinner's eyes widened. "Where
did you get that information?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you my sources, Mr.
Skinner. Not yet, anyhow. But I
have enough information to tell me
that you're the man. It wouldn't hold
up in court, but, with the additional
information you can give me, I think
it will."</p>

<p>Skinner looked baffled, as if not
knowing what to say next.</p>

<p>"Mr. Skinner," Elshawe went on,
"a research reporter has to have a
little of the crusader in him, and
maybe I've got more than most.
You've discovered one of the greatest
things in history&mdash;or invented it,
whatever you want to call it. You
deserve to go down in history along
with Newton, Watt, Roentgen, Edison,
Einstein, Fermi, and all the
rest.</p>

<p>"But somehow Malcom Porter
stole your invention and he intends
to take full credit for it. Oh, I know
he's paid you plenty of money not
to make any fuss, and he probably
thinks you couldn't prove anything,
anyway. But you don't have to be
satisfied with his conscience money
any more. With the backing of Magnum
Telenews, you can blow Mister
Glory-hound Porter's phony setup
wide open and take the credit you
deserve."</p>

<p>Skinner didn't look at all the way
Elshawe had expected. Instead, he
frowned a little and said: "I'm glad
you came, Mr. Elshawe. I didn't
realize that there was enough evidence
to connect me with his project."
But he didn't look exactly
overjoyed.</p>

<p>"Well," Elshawe said tentatively,
"if you'll just answer a few questions&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just a minute, Mr. Elshawe. Do
you mind if I ask you a few questions
first?"</p>

<p>"Go ahead."</p>

<p>Skinner leaned forward earnestly.
"Mr. Elshawe, who deserves credit
for an invention? Who deserves the
money?"</p>

<p>"Why ... why, the inventor, of
course."</p>

<p>"The inventor? Or the man who
gives it to humanity?"</p>

<p>"I ... don't quite follow you."</p>

<p>He leaned back in his chair again.
"Mr. Elshawe, when I invented the
Polarizer, I hadn't the remotest idea
of what I'd invented. I taught general
science in the high school Malcom
Porter went to, and I had a lab
in my basement. Porter was a pretty
bright boy, and he liked to come
around to my lab and watch me putter
around. I had made this gadget&mdash;it
was a toy for children as far as
I was concerned. I didn't have any
idea of its worth. It was just a little
gadget that hopped up into the air
and floated down again. Cute, but
worthless, except as a novelty. And
it was too expensive to build it as a
novelty. So I forgot about it.</p>

<p>"Years later, Porter came around
to me and offered to buy it. I dug
it out of the junk that was in my
little workshop and sold it to him.</p>

<p>"A couple of years after that, he
came back. He said that he'd invented
something. After beating all around
the bush, he finally admitted that
his invention was a development of
my little toy. He offered me a million
dollars if I'd keep my mouth
shut and forget all about the thing."</p>

<p>"And you accepted?" Elshawe
asked incredulously.</p>

<p>"Certainly! I made him buy me a
tax-paid annuity that pays me more
than enough to get by on. I don't
want wealth, Mr. Elshawe&mdash;just
comfort. And that's why I gave it to
him."</p>

<hr />

<p>"I don't follow you."</p>

<p>"Let me tell you about Malcom
Porter. He is one of that vast horde
of people who want to be <i>someone</i>.
They want to be respected and looked
up to. But they either can't, or
won't, take the time to learn the
basics of the field they want to excel
in. The beautiful girl who wants to
be an actress without bothering to
learn to act; the young man who
wants to be a judge without going
through law school, or be a general
without studying military tactics; and
Malcom Porter, the boy who wanted
to be a great scientist&mdash;but didn't
want to take the trouble to learn
science."</p>

<p>Elshawe nodded. He was thinking
of the "artists" who splatter up clean
canvas and call it "artistic self-expression."
And the clodheads who
write disconnected, meaningless
prose and claim that it's free verse.
The muddleminds who forget that
Picasso learned to paint within the
strict limits of classical art before
he tried new methods, and that
James Joyce learned to handle the
English language well before he
wrote "Finnegan's Wake."</p>

<p>"On the other hand," Skinner
continued, "I am ... well, rather a
shy man. As soon as Malcom told
me what the device would do when
it was properly powered, I knew that
there would be trouble. I am not a
fighter, Mr. Elshawe. I have no desire
to spend time in prison or be
vilified in the news or called a crackpot
by orthodox scientists.</p>

<p>"I don't want to fight Malcom's
claim, Mr. Elshawe. Don't you see,
he <i>deserves</i> the credit! In the first
place, he recognized it for what it
was. If he hadn't, Heaven only
knows how long it would have been
before someone rediscovered it. In
the second place, he has fought and
fought hard to give it to humanity.
He has suffered in prison and spent
millions of dollars to get the Polarizer
into the hands of the United
States Government. He has, in fact,
worked harder and suffered more
than if he'd taken the time and trouble
to get a proper education. And
it got him what he wanted; I doubt
that he would have made a very
good scientist, anyway.</p>

<p>"Porter deserves every bit of
credit for the Polarizer. I am perfectly
happy with the way things are
working out."</p>

<p>Elshawe said: "But what if the
FBI gets hold of the evidence I
have?"</p>

<p>"That's why I have told you the
truth, Mr. Elshawe," Skinner said
earnestly. "I want you to destroy
that evidence. I would deny flatly
that I had anything to do with the
Polarizer, in any case. And that
would put an end to any inquiry because
no one would believe that I
would deny inventing something like
that. But I would just as soon that
the question never came up. I would
rather that there be no whisper
whatever of anything like that."</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, then,
very carefully, he said: "Mr. Elshawe,
you have intimated that the inventor
of the Polarizer deserves some kind
of reward. I assure you that the
greatest reward you could give me
would be to help me destroy all
traces of any connection with the
device. Will you do that, Mr. Elshawe?"</p>

<p>Elshawe just sat silently in the
chair for long minutes, thinking.
Skinner didn't interrupt; he simply
waited patiently.</p>

<p>After about ten minutes, Elshawe
put his pipe carefully on a nearby
table and reached down to pick up
his briefcase. He handed it to Skinner.</p>

<p>"Here. It contains all the evidence
I have. Including, I might say, the
recording of our conversation here.
Just take the tape out of the minirecorder.
A man like you deserves
whatever reward he wants. Take it,
Mr. Skinner."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Skinner softly,
taking the briefcase.</p>

<hr />

<p>And, on the plane winging back
to New York from the Congressional
investigation, Mr. Terrence Elshawe
sighed softly. He was glad none of
the senators had asked anything
about Skinner, because he knew he
would certainly have had to tell the
truth.</p>

<p>And he knew, just as certainly,
that he would have been in a great
deal more hot water than Porter had
been. Because Malcom Porter was
going to become American Hero
Number One, and Terry Elshawe
would have ended up as the lying
little sneak who had tried to destroy
the reputation of the great Malcom
Porter.</p>

<p>Which, all things considered,
would have been a hell of a note.</p>

<p class="theend">THE END</p>
